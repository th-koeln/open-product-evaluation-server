							<h3>Clients</h3>
							<p>
									Clients can be created by anybody using this project and they are not restricted by the tasks explained in the last section. Be creative and build your own client. The technology used does not matter, as long as it supports http-requests, as well as socket-connections (for subscriptions). Every client should at least subscribe and react to changes of its own data-structure (has it been deleted? has a new domain been applied by its owner? etc.). If a client is supposed to give answers, it needs to provide the answers to all the questions of a survey (if it can't answer a specific question, it needs to answer it in a neutral way by providing the value 'null').
							</p>

							<p>
									To create a temporary client, the mutation <em><strong>createTemporaryClient</strong></em> needs to be called. 
									Because it is only allowed to answer one survey, the identifier of the domain, it wants to be connected to, needs to be provided. 
									An example would be:
							</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">createTemporaryClient(data: { domainID: "ID of the domain" }) {
	client {
		id
		name
		domain {
			activeSurvey {
				id 
				... # Other survey-attributes that are needed
			}
			... # Other domain-attributes that are needed
		}
		... # Other client-attributes that are needed
	}
	token
}</code></pre>

							<p>
									To create a permanent client, the mutation <em><strong>createPermanentClient</strong></em> needs to be called. 
									When creating such a client, it needs to provide the email of a registered user / owner it 
									should belong to, as well as a name for recognizing it in the adminview.
							</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
createPermanentClient(data: { email: "Email of the user", name: "My client" }) {
	client {
		id
		name
		owners { ... } # Whatever user-attributes are needed
		... # Other client-attributes that are needed
	}
	code
	token
}</code></pre>

							<p>As response, they get the newly created client-object and a JWT, they need to add in the
								Authorization-header of every request to authorize it ( 'Authorization': 'Bearer JWT').
								In addition, permanent clients get a code. These clients have the possibility to login
								again, if they were shut down or a new device (hardware) should be used as a
								replacement. To login, they need to call the mutation <em><strong>loginClient</strong></em> 
								and provide the code as password, as well as the
								email of their owner.</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
loginClient(data: { code: "The code", email: "Email of the owner" }) {
	client {
		id
		name
		domain {
			activeSurvey { ... } # Whatever survey-attributes are needed
			... # Other domain-attributes are needed
		}
		... # Other client-attributes that are needed
	}
	code
	token
}</code></pre>

							<p>After creating a temporary client, its deletion timer starts and it should immediately
								begin to answer the questions.</p>

							<p>Permanent clients on the other hand are now allowed to get a list of public domains and
								decide which one they want to process (unless they already know the domain identifier
								and directly connect to it or get assigned by their owner). To connect to a domain, the
								<em><strong>updateClient</strong></em>
								mutation needs to be called and the domain identifier needs to be provided.</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
updateClient(clientID: "ID of the client", data: { domain: "ID of the domain" }) {
	client {
		id
		name
		domain {
			activeSurvey { ... } # Whatever survey-attributes are needed
			... # Other domain-attributes are needed
		}
		... # Other client-attributes that are needed
	}
}</code></pre>

							<p>Now the permanent client is allowed to subscribe to the changes of it's assigned domain
								and all the clients, that are inside of that domain. Other now possible subscriptions
								are all the answers made in this domain and all votes persisted for the survey of that
								domain.</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
domainUpdate(domainID: "ID of the domain") {
	event
	changedAttributes
	stateKey
	domain { ... } # Whatever domain-attributes need to be watched
}

clientUpdate(clientID: "ID of the client") {
	event
	changedAttributes
	client { ... } # Whatever client-attributes need to be watched
}

answerUpdate(domainID: "ID of the domain") { # Optional: provide a clientID to only subscribe it's answers in that domain
	event
	changedAttributes
	answer { ... } # Whatever answer-attributes need to be watched
	clientId
}

voteUpdate(surveyID: "ID of the survey") {
	event
	vote { ... } # Whatever vote-attributes need to be watched (for visualizations)
	surveyId
	summaries { ... } # Whatever summary-attributes need to be watched (for visualizations)
}</code></pre>

							<p>To answer a question, the <em><strong>setAnswer</strong></em>
								mutation needs to be called and filled by question specific input. Is a client not able
								to give the answer or does the participant not want to give an answer, the question
								specific field needs to be filled with 'null' (for a neutral answer). Did a client
								answer all questions, a vote (containing all answers and additional information) is
								persisted and the <em><strong>voteCreated</strong></em> flag (inside the payload of the
								setAnswer-mutation) is set to true, so that the client knows that it finished one
								voting.</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
setAnswer(data: { questionID: "ID of the question", attributeThatMatchesQuestionType: answerThatMatchesAttribute }) {
	answer { ... } # Whatever answer-attributes are needed
	voteCreated
}</code></pre>

							<p>To remove a client from a domain, the <em><strong>updateClient</strong></em> mutation must 
								be called with the domain-attribute
								set to 'null'. Keep in mind that temporary clients will be deleted afterwards.</p>

							<pre><code class="graphql language-graphql">
updateClient(clientID: "ID of the client", data: { domain: null }) {
	client {
		id
		name
		... # Other client-attributes that are needed
	}
}</code></pre>

							<p>(all interactions with clients are listed and explained in the API-documentation)</p>
